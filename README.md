## üé® Design Approach

The design follows a clean, minimalist direction, prioritizing usability and readability.

- **Color Scheme:** A calm color palette that highlights important UI elements like buttons and links without overwhelming the user. Dark mode is also supported for better accessibility and user preference.
- **Responsiveness:** Built mobile-first with **Tailwind CSS**, ensuring seamless usability across devices ‚Äî from phones to desktops.

## üîç SEO Strategy

SEO has been considered from the ground up:

- **Meta Tags / Open Graph:** (Ready to be implemented) Supports dynamic page metadata for better visibility and social sharing
- **Structured Data:** (Optional enhancement) Can integrate JSON-LD for richer search results
- **Image Optimization:** Uses Next.js `Image` component for lazy loading, resizing, and compression
- **Semantic HTML:** Ensures meaningful markup that search engines can parse effectively
- **Performance Tweaks:** Includes fast loading via image optimization, layout shifting reduction, and selective rendering

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Error Handling Strategy

- **Product Data Fetching:** If loading `products.json` fails, the app handles it gracefully with user-friendly feedback instead of crashing
- **Cart Operations:** Prevents adding invalid items and handles edge cases (like out-of-stock or duplicate entries in future extensions)
- **Unknown Routes:** Default Next.js 404 handling, customizable for better UX
- **UI Feedback:** Uses `use-toast` from `shadcn/ui` to notify users of errors or actions
- **Logging:** (Can be extended) Errors can be logged to console or external services
- **Recovery Options:** Where possible, users are given clear paths to retry or navigate elsewhere
